# EB-Websocket_Exercise
 Websocket and React exercise

In the backend folder run ```npm i``` <br />
In the frontend folder run ```npm i``` <br /> <br /> <br />

In the frontend folder run ```npm start``` <br />
In the backend run ```npm start``` <br /> <br />

The order should not matter. To redo just end both processes and run again. If there is an error where socket.io does not show client has connected you may need to toggle ignore CORS
